Kia ora! My name is Amber Peek and you're reading my blog.

I am a Masters student in Geography at the University of Auckland looking at **virtual reality** and **environmental education**. My supervisor is Michael Martin, and he has an awesome blog (which this is based off) at [locative.dev](https://locative.dev/) - you should definitely check it out, there's heaps of cool stuff.

The main point of this blog is to have an outlet for my thoughts through the reading process of my Masters. The posts will likely be half way between op-ed style blogging and literature reviews. Who knows, maybe I'll like it and will keep doing it after my thesis is done!
