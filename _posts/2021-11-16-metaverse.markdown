*Throughout this post, I will refer to the company in question as Facebook, due to the ongoing [cease and desist](https://meta.company/) from Meta Company (unaffiliated) due to the confusion and alleged trademark infringement Facebook’s rebrand causes.*

About a month ago, Facebook [announced](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/) that they would be rebranding to Meta.

> Meta’s focus will be to bring the metaverse to life and help people connect, find communities and grow businesses.

Given that Facebook [acquired Oculus](https://about.facebook.com/company-info/) in 2014, and the heavy Facebook [integration](https://support.oculus.com/articles/accounts/facebook-accounts-on-oculus/index-facebook-accounts-on-oculus/) in the Oculus Quest 2, it comes as no surprise the tech giant is pushing further into the virtual reality space with its latest rebrand. Two months prior to the announcement, Facebook (as Oculus) launched [Horizon Workrooms](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/introducing-horizon-workrooms-remote-collaboration-reimagined/), a virtual reality workplace similar to (boring) rooms in [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/). Truly a dream come true for those who are just itching to return to the office with too-cold air conditioning, loud coworkers, and forced conversation. “Not everyone will always have a VR headset ready”, says Facebook about Horizon Workrooms’ support for video calling, embodying the spirit of this GIF perfectly:

I’ll use Facebook’s latest venture to ground a broader discussion of metaverses and the role of virtual reality in reality in general.
