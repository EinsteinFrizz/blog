*Throughout this post, I will refer to the company in question as Facebook, due to the ongoing [cease and desist](https://meta.company/) from Meta Company (unaffiliated) due to the confusion and alleged trademark infringement Facebook’s rebrand causes.*

About a month ago, Facebook [announced](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/) that they would be rebranding to Meta.

> Meta’s focus will be to bring the metaverse to life and help people connect, find communities and grow businesses.

Given that Facebook [acquired Oculus](https://about.facebook.com/company-info/) in 2014, and the heavy Facebook [integration](https://support.oculus.com/articles/accounts/facebook-accounts-on-oculus/index-facebook-accounts-on-oculus/) in the Oculus Quest 2, it comes as no surprise the tech giant is pushing further into the virtual reality space with its latest rebrand. Two months prior to the announcement, Facebook (as Oculus) launched [Horizon Workrooms](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/introducing-horizon-workrooms-remote-collaboration-reimagined/), a virtual reality workplace similar to (boring) rooms in [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/). Truly a dream come true for those who are just itching to return to the office with too-cold air conditioning, loud coworkers, and forced conversation. “Not everyone will always have a VR headset ready”, says Facebook about Horizon Workrooms’ support for video calling, embodying the spirit of this GIF perfectly:

<p>I’ll use Facebook’s latest venture to ground a broader discussion of metaverses and the role of virtual reality in reality in general.</p>

# What is a Metaverse?
The 1992 novel *Snow Crash* by Neal Stephenson is [cited by some](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/nyls49&i=93) as the introduction of the concept of the metaverse. The key of the metaverse, as opposed to worlds in MMORPGs like RuneScape, is that it is presented as a reality to the users. The metaverse is essentially the embodiment of the pop culture cyberspace fantasies of the '90s and early '00s, enabled by the remarkable leaps in technology (both hardware and software) since then.

[Chris Matthieu](https://medium.com/metaverses/remember-cyberspace-its-what-we-called-the-future-of-the-internet-before-the-metaverse-9be03a83122e) puts it well: "Remember Cyberspace? It’s what we called the Future of the Internet before the Metaverse".

The cyberspace-metaverse is a concept explored in many well-known pieces of media. These are some of my favourites:

* Snow Crash – Neal Stephenson (book, 1992)
* ReBoot – Mainframe Entertainment (television series, 1994-2001)
* The Matrix – Lana & Lilly Wachowski (film, 1999)
* Altered Carbon – Richard K. Morgan (book 2002, television series 2018)

Even the Tamagotchi was [branded](https://web.archive.org/web/19980709195449/http://www.bandai.com/pressroom/98tama.html) as "the virtual reality pet" in 1998, embodying the idea of the multiverse with its later use of [infrared connection](https://web.archive.org/web/20040703145011/http://tamagotchi.com/news/news.cfm?wn_id=71) between units and integration with a website.
