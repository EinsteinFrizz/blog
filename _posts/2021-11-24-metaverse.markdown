*Throughout this post, I will refer to the company in question as Facebook, due to the ongoing [cease and desist](https://meta.company/) from Meta Company (unaffiliated) due to the confusion and alleged trademark infringement Facebook’s rebrand causes.*

About a month ago, Facebook [announced](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/) that they would be rebranding to Meta.
> Meta’s focus will be to bring the metaverse to life and help people connect, find communities and grow businesses.

Given that Facebook [acquired Oculus](https://about.facebook.com/company-info/) in 2014, and the heavy Facebook [integration](https://support.oculus.com/articles/accounts/facebook-accounts-on-oculus/index-facebook-accounts-on-oculus/) in the Oculus Quest 2, it comes as no surprise the tech giant is pushing further into the virtual reality space with its latest rebrand. Two months prior to the announcement, Facebook (as Oculus) launched [Horizon Workrooms](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/introducing-horizon-workrooms-remote-collaboration-reimagined/), a virtual reality workplace similar to (boring) rooms in [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/). Truly a dream come true for those who are just itching to return to the office with too-cold air conditioning, loud coworkers, and forced conversation. “Not everyone will always have a VR headset ready”, says Facebook about Horizon Workrooms’ support for video calling, embodying the spirit of this GIF perfectly:

<p>I’ll use Facebook’s latest venture to ground a broader discussion of metaverses and the role of virtual reality in reality in general.</p>

# What is a Metaverse?
The 1992 novel *Snow Crash* by Neal Stephenson is [cited by some](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/nyls49&i=93) as the introduction of the concept of the metaverse. The key of the metaverse, as opposed to worlds in MMORPGs like RuneScape, is that it is presented as a reality to the users. The metaverse is essentially the embodiment of the pop culture cyberspace fantasies of the '90s and early '00s, enabled by the remarkable leaps in technology (both hardware and software) since then.

[Chris Matthieu](https://medium.com/metaverses/remember-cyberspace-its-what-we-called-the-future-of-the-internet-before-the-metaverse-9be03a83122e) puts it well: "Remember Cyberspace? It’s what we called the Future of the Internet before the Metaverse".

The cyberspace-metaverse is a concept explored in many well-known pieces of media. These are some of my favourites:

* Snow Crash – Neal Stephenson (book, 1992)
* ReBoot – Mainframe Entertainment (television series, 1994-2001)
* The Matrix – Lana & Lilly Wachowski (film, 1999)
* Altered Carbon – Richard K. Morgan (book 2002, television series 2018)

Even the Tamagotchi was [branded](https://web.archive.org/web/19980709195449/http://www.bandai.com/pressroom/98tama.html) as "the virtual reality pet" in 1998, embodying the idea of the multiverse with its later use of [infrared connection](https://web.archive.org/web/20040703145011/http://tamagotchi.com/news/news.cfm?wn_id=71) between units and integration with a website.

An aside: *Snow Crash* is [credited](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2003.12.014) with the popularisation of many modern terms referring to cyberspace/metaverse/online concepts and is generally a great read, so I would 1000% recommend checking it out (don't forget your local library often has eBooks and audiobooks available for free!).

Given that metaverses are no new invention, what exactly is Facebook doing and why are they touting it as the next greatest technological innovation?

# Facebook and the Meta&#xB2;verse

Meta and its Metaverse isn't Facebook's first foray into the virtual reality scene. Poking around on the various websites Facebook hosts reveals multiple projects the company has been working on, many of which appear to be predecessors to their Metaverse. These projects from Facebook's (Reality Labs)[https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/] involve virtual reality integrated workplaces ([Workplace, Oculus for Business](https://tech.fb.com/the-future-of-work-and-the-next-computing-platform/)), video calling devices ([Portal](https://portal.facebook.com/nz/)), and augmented reality ([Spark AR](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/)). I don't know about you, but none of these sound particularly groundbreaking (certainly not a tablet that can seemingly only do video calls), and I hadn't heard of any of them until writing this. Given that Facebook seems to be reinventing the wheels (or hopping on the bandwagons) of Zoom/Microsoft Teams/Google Meet/Skype/Messenger, Google Drive/Microsoft OneDrive, and Unity/Unreal Engine/ARKit, is the Meta Metaverse anything new?

## A Brief Tangent into Semantics

Facebook refers to this metaverse as ***the*** Metaverse, while I refer to it as ***their*** Metaverse. This is for two key reasons:

1. I refuse to believe companies like Google, Amazon, and potentially Apple will co-operate to produce one unified metaverse, rather than creating their own versions to capitalise off of – see all the streaming services with exclusive content that have sprung up in the past few years.

1. If giant corporations with monopolies or oligopolies are in charge of these metaverses, will they really serve the interests of the common person? Or will they continue the pattern of commodifying user data as people become increasingly reliant on these technologies to keep up with society?

# Metaverse or Multiverse?

# Whose Reality is it Anyway?

*Snow Crash* addresses the issue of access to technology, the inequities it creates, and the lengths people go to to access these technologies that put them on the same level as the elite, even if this has financial consequences:
> In the real world-planet Earth, Reality, there are somewhere between six and ten billion people.  At any given time, most of them are making mud bricks or field-stripping their AK-47s.  Perhaps a billion of them have enough money to own a computer; these people have more money than all of the others put together.  Of these billion potential computer owners, maybe a quarter of them actually bother to own computers, and a quarter of these have machines that are powerful enough to handle the Street protocol.  That makes for about sixty million people who can be on the Street at any given time.  Add in another sixty million or so who can't really afford it but go there anyway, by using public machines, or machines owned by their school or their employer, and at any given time the Street is occupied by twice the population of New York City.

Needless to say, Facebook's Metaverse will run on servers owned by Facebook, rather than independent community-owned servers, and this gives Facebook a fundamental power over the reality of the Metaverse not unlike a deity.

## The Dawn of Doublethink and Newspeak?

In an era of the Internet where [TikTok users](https://prisonhannibal.tumblr.com/post/656800972359843840/im-so-glad-tumblr-is-my-social-media-of-choice) are being forced to adopt [13375P34K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) to avoid getting stifled by the algorithm or outright banned for talking about subjects deemed unacceptable for the platform (including [LGBTQ+ content](https://www.them.us/story/lgbtq-users-reportedly-being-censored-by-tiktok)), it seems inevitable that there will be some level of censorship in the Facebook Metaverse.

<div class="tumblr-post" data-href="https://embed.tumblr.com/embed/post/MM95EyILrPV_Ur9A4qc5Tw/656800972359843840" data-did="61eca88908a62169d8517e60133eae8eb2fe7130" style="margin: auto; display: block; text-align: center"><a href="https://prisonhannibal.tumblr.com/post/656800972359843840/im-so-glad-tumblr-is-my-social-media-of-choice">https://prisonhannibal.tumblr.com/post/656800972359843840/im-so-glad-tumblr-is-my-social-media-of-choice</a></div>  <script async src="https://assets.tumblr.com/post.js"></script>

In the physical realm, people can discuss whatever topics they like, their words ephemeral ripples in the air that can go completely unheard and that leave no trace of their existence. In the digital realm, there is no such thing.

# Where am I?

This is a relatively simple question in the physical realm, but much a more complex one in the Metaverse.

If someone asks me where I work, I can tell them exactly where down to [ten-thousandths of a degree](https://xkcd.com/2170/) or up to what supercluster complex we live in (it's the [Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1986ApJ...303...25T)).

# Will we ~~plebs~~ embrace the Metaverse?

I remember when I joined Facebook. It was 2013 and all my friends were using it to communicate, and I was distinctly missing out on making friends at my new high school due to not having it. Being one of (what seems like) the last classes of kids to be taught not to share personal information online, I used a pseudonym, which I quickly changed to my real name following questioning from my peers and encouragement from the adults in my life – ironic, given that these are the same adults who were so focused on my online security.

Cut to 2021 and Facebook Messenger is my primary communication platform to my friends, partners, some of my family even. The cognitive dissonance is real between my reliance on this (in my opinion) leech on society of a company and my love of free and open source software and Internet privacy. Nowadays, I run Facebook in a container on Firefox, with ad and script blockers, privacy extensions, you name it, I run it. I refuse to link my phone number and contacts (even though no doubt they already have my number from someone else uploading their contacts), or to use my account to sign in to any other services wherever possible. And yet, despite my hatred for the company, I return to it without fail every day. As I write this, Messenger is prominently open on one of my monitors in its usual place.

I tell you this anecdote not to brag about my privacy-consciousness (or make you think I wear a tin foil hat), but to illustrate how invasive technologies creep into our lives, sometimes by choice, sometimes by social (or other) necessity. My hypothesis is that we may not willingly go out and buy virtual reality headsets just so we can log in to the Metaverse in our spare time. No, I suspect that businesses, especially large national or multinational ones, will see the Metaverse as an opportunity to 'enhance' the work environment (and likely intrude further into their workers' home lives) and make it a compulsory part of working.
