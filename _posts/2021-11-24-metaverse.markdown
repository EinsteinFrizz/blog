*Throughout this post, I will refer to the company in question as Facebook, due to the ongoing [cease and desist](https://meta.company/) from Meta Company (unaffiliated) due to the confusion and alleged trademark infringement Facebook’s rebrand causes.*

About a month ago, Facebook [announced](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/) that they would be rebranding to Meta.

> Meta’s focus will be to bring the metaverse to life and help people connect, find communities and grow businesses.

Given that Facebook [acquired Oculus](https://about.facebook.com/company-info/) in 2014, and the heavy Facebook [integration](https://support.oculus.com/articles/accounts/facebook-accounts-on-oculus/index-facebook-accounts-on-oculus/) in the Oculus Quest 2, it comes as no surprise the tech giant is pushing further into the virtual reality space with its latest rebrand. Two months prior to the announcement, Facebook (as Oculus) launched [Horizon Workrooms](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/introducing-horizon-workrooms-remote-collaboration-reimagined/), a virtual reality workplace similar to (boring) rooms in [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/). Truly a dream come true for those who are just itching to return to the office with too-cold air conditioning, loud coworkers, and forced conversation. “Not everyone will always have a VR headset ready”, says Facebook about Horizon Workrooms’ support for video calling, embodying the spirit of this GIF perfectly:

<p>I’ll use Facebook’s latest venture to ground a broader discussion of metaverses and the role of virtual reality in reality in general.</p>

# What is a Metaverse?
The 1992 novel *Snow Crash* by Neal Stephenson is [cited by some](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/nyls49&i=93) as the introduction of the concept of the metaverse. The key of the metaverse, as opposed to worlds in MMORPGs like RuneScape, is that it is presented as a reality to the users. The metaverse is essentially the embodiment of the pop culture cyberspace fantasies of the '90s and early '00s, enabled by the remarkable leaps in technology (both hardware and software) since then.

[Chris Matthieu](https://medium.com/metaverses/remember-cyberspace-its-what-we-called-the-future-of-the-internet-before-the-metaverse-9be03a83122e) puts it well: "Remember Cyberspace? It’s what we called the Future of the Internet before the Metaverse".

The cyberspace-metaverse is a concept explored in many well-known pieces of media. These are some of my favourites:

* Snow Crash – Neal Stephenson (book, 1992)
* ReBoot – Mainframe Entertainment (television series, 1994-2001)
* The Matrix – Lana & Lilly Wachowski (film, 1999)
* Altered Carbon – Richard K. Morgan (book 2002, television series 2018)

Even the Tamagotchi was [branded](https://web.archive.org/web/19980709195449/http://www.bandai.com/pressroom/98tama.html) as "the virtual reality pet" in 1998, embodying the idea of the multiverse with its later use of [infrared connection](https://web.archive.org/web/20040703145011/http://tamagotchi.com/news/news.cfm?wn_id=71) between units and integration with a website.

Given that metaverses are no new invention, what exactly is Facebook doing and why are they touting it as the next greatest technological innovation?

# Facebook and the Meta&#xB2;verse

Meta and its Metaverse isn't Facebook's first foray into the virtual reality scene. Poking around on the various websites Facebook hosts reveals multiple projects the company has been working on, many of which appear to be predecessors to their Metaverse. These projects from Facebook's (Reality Labs)[https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/] involve virtual reality integrated workplaces ([Workplace, Oculus for Business](https://tech.fb.com/the-future-of-work-and-the-next-computing-platform/)), video calling devices ([Portal](https://portal.facebook.com/nz/)), and augmented reality ([Spark AR](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/)). I don't know about you, but none of these sound particularly groundbreaking (certainly not a tablet that can seemingly only do video calls), and I hadn't heard of any of them until writing this. Given that Facebook seems to be reinventing the wheels (or hopping on the bandwagons) of Zoom/Microsoft Teams/Google Meet/Skype/Messenger, Google Drive/Microsoft OneDrive, and Unity/Unreal Engine/ARKit, is the Meta Metaverse anything new?

## A Brief Tangent into Semantics

Facebook refers to this metaverse as ***the*** Metaverse, while I refer to it as ***their*** Metaverse. This is for two key reasons:

1. I refuse to believe companies like Google, Amazon, and potentially Apple will co-operate to produce one unified metaverse, rather than creating their own versions to capitalise off of – see all the streaming services with exclusive content that have sprung up in the past few years.

1. If giant corporations with monopolies or [oligopolies]("An economic condition in which a small number of sellers exert control over the market of a commodity. (Wiktionary)") are in charge of these metaverses, will they really serve the interests of the common person? Or will they continue the pattern of commodifying user data as people become increasingly reliant on these technologies to keep up with society?
