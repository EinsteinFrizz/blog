What is reality?

Philosophers have spent centuries now asking and answering this question, and I am certainly not qualified to provide a definitive answer (as much as I'd love to be omniscient), however I reserve my right to speculate here. Within the context of this blog post, I'd like to focus specifically on virtual reality, and when (if?) it becomes *real* reality.

"Real reality" &ndash; great wording there, good job Amber.

# Ok, but we have to draw the line somewhere

It's all well and good having this philosophical view that virtual reality and reality may be indistinguishable, but we live in the a world where we need practical definitions for things.

Virtual reality technology exists on a continuum, with [CAVE](https://www.doi.org/10.1145/129888.129892) setups being considered a form of virtual reality, despite not being what we might imagine as a typical VR setup. Within the context of virtual reality environmental research, specifically that which utilises interviews, there are multiple continuums at play, including:

* In person interviews &harr; Fully virtual interviews
* Highly connected to the environment &harr; Highly disconnected from the environment
* Minimal use of technology &harr; Technology integrated in all possible aspects
